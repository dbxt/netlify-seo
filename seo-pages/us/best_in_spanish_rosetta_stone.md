  If you want to say the word “best” in Spanish, it’s generally going to be
  “*méjor*.” But it’s going to depend on how you intend to use it. If you’re
  referring to a man or masculine noun, you would say “*lo méjor*.” Referring to
  a woman or feminine noun? Then use “*la méjor*.”


  Mastering the ins-and-out of “best” and other superlatives in Spanish can seem intimidating, but they come naturally with practice—particularly if you already speak related languages like English, French, or Italian. Italian and French are quite closely related to Spanish, both being in the same Latin/“romance language” family—whereas the English language uses many French and Latin/Italian words and phrases that are direct cognates (lingual cousins of one another). That’s why you’ll notice that there are many English words and phrases like the word “generosity” that sound remarkably similar in French (*générosité*), Italian (*generosità*), and Spanish (*generosidad*).


  Many students of Spanish find it has a very easy to understand pronunciation system, with the exception of just a few irregularities in pronunciation. This is, fortunately, unlike English (known to be among the most difficult languages to master). Better yet, the Spanish alphabet is an almost near-match to English and the majority of other major European languages. There are only three more letters you will need to learn:*ch (chay)*,*ñ (eñe)*, and*ll (elle)*.


  With Rosetta Stone’s immersive approach, you’ll learn the language, not just the words. What makes Rosetta Stone unique is that we prepare you to use your new language in the real world. So it’s not just about the features, but what you’re able to do because of them. That way, you’ll be ready to handle any situation while sounding great.


  If you combine individual practice in Rosetta Stone’s award-winning mobile app and practice with other Spanish language learners in Live Tutoring, you can have absolute control over your learning speed and, ultimately, your long-term progress.

  For beginning Spanish language learners, there are some basic building blocks
  that make for a great place to start. These basic building blocks are
  essential words and phrases such as who, what, when, where, why, yes, no,
  please, and more. Mastering these basics can put you on the path to everyday
  conversation in Spanish. Here’s a more complete list of the basic words and
  phrases:


  *Sí*/ Yes\

  *No*/ No\

  *¿Quién?*/ Who?\

  *¿Qué?*/ What?\

  *¿Por qué?*/ Why?\

  *¿Dónde?*/ Where?\

  *Hola*/ Hello\

  *Me gusta*/ I like\

  *No me gusta*/ I don’t like\

  *Adiós*/ Goodbye\

  *Por favor*/ Please\

  *Gracias*/ Thank You\

  *Lo siento*/ Sorry\

  *Salud*/ Bless you\


  As you may have noticed—Spanish does have a few crucial differences in pronunciation that can make it a bit of a challenge for some learners, at least early on. One example is found with the letter r which is pronounced differently and takes some practice for most new learners. This distinct sound is formed by tapping the tip of the tongue on the roof of the mouth, about a third of the way back in the mouth. Some Spanish language experts counsel new Spanish learners to practice making the “tt” sound, as it sounds in the English word butter.


  Advancing your Spanish pronunciation skills depends on getting feedback that will allow you to make corrections, and then practicing—until both your tongue and brain develop the habit of forming the sounds that comprise the Spanish language. Rosetta Stone’s patented speech-recognition engine, named TruAccent, is integrated into every language lesson to provide essential feedback on your pronunciation. TruAccent compares your pronunciation to that of native and non-native speakers, and gives you real-time feedback for the most accurate pronunciation. TruAccent pronunciation sensitivity is also adjustable, allowing you to fine-tune your Spanish accent. TruAccent was developed by capturing and integrating the natural speech of Spanish speakers, giving you one of the most powerful tools available to help you speak Spanish confidently.


  Once you’ve learned the basics—the foundation of the Spanish language—you’ll be able to move on to learning even longer phrases that form the backbone of daily conversations. Rosetta Stone’s bite-sized and targeted language lessons are built with this objective in mind. Rosetta Stone’s lessons move you toward speaking and conversing in Spanish with comfort and confidence in everyday situations. To continue to progress with speaking Spanish, it will help to focus on specific strategies and tactics that accelerate your understanding of the language. Rosetta Stone makes that process feel entirely natural.
