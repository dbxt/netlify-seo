section_1_text: >-
  If you’d like to say “I am hungry” in Spanish, you’d say *“Tengo hambre.”*
  Even though it’s not an exact translation—it means “I have hunger”—it’s the
  most common phrase used by Spanish speakers. From time to time, you may hear
  someone say *“Estoy hambrienta.”* It means the same thing, but it’s not used
  as often. To express the hunger of different groups of people, you would
  simply conjugate the verb *“tener.”* Let’s take a look:


  *Tengo hambre. /* I am hungry.


  *Tienes hambre. /* You are hungry.


  *Tiene hambre. /* He/she is hungry.


  *Tenemos hambre. /* We are hungry.


  *Tenéis hambre. /* You all are hungry.


  *Tienen hambre. /* They are hungry.

  Some people choose to learn Spanish because they find themselves encountering
  the language in their everyday lives. After all, Spanish is heard in popular
  music, movies, and TV shows. Other people want to learn Spanish based on their
  plans to work, vacation, or volunteer in one of the 20 countries where Spanish
  is the official language. Whatever your reason, you can get off to a great
  start by learning how to pronounce some basic Spanish words and phrases first.
  It is an important step to understand and be understood by any of the 437
  million people around the world who speak Spanish.


  Often times, new learners get sidetracked trying to memorize lengthy lists of Spanish vocabulary words and phrases. This tedious and time-consuming effort can lead to the undesired outcome of having little-to-no ability to participate in everyday Spanish conversation. That’s why it’s strongly advised that new Spanish language learners focus on understanding and pronouncing basic words and phrases most commonly used in real-world Spanish. This smart and practical approach to learning Spanish will help you become a confident and comfortable Spanish speaker.


  It’s worth noting that Spanish does have some pronunciation distinctions that can make it a challenge for language learners. As one example, the letter *r* is pronounced differently and takes some practice for most new learners. This distinct sound is formed by tapping the tip of the tongue on the roof of the mouth, about a third of the way back in the mouth. Some Spanish language experts suggest new learners practice making the “tt” sound, as it sounds in the English word butter.


  Developing the skills to accurately pronounce Spanish requires immediate feedback on your pronunciation efforts. Rosetta Stone helps you dial in your pronunciation with our TruAccent™ speech-recognition engine. TruAccent compares your voice to native and non-native speakers—in real-time—so you get the feedback you need for the most accurate pronunciation. It’s also adjustable, which allows you to tweak your accent as needed. TruAccent is a powerful tool for helping you learn and speak the Spanish language.


  After you have the basics down, you can move onto learning the longer phrases you’ll use in everyday conversation. Rosetta Stone’s digestible, 10-minute language lessons are designed to lead you along this natural path to learning. You’ll first focus on learning Spanish basic words and phrases, then you’ll move onto learning longer Spanish phrases, and then towards learning to speak Spanish with confidence.
