  If you want to say “I love you more” in Spanish, you would say,*“te amo
  más”*(for romantic expressions of love) or*“te quiero más”*(for friends and
  family). Of course, this isn’t 100% consistent across the Spanish-speaking
  world, so you may notice some differences by region.


  If Spanish grammar and verbs seem a little tricky to you, don’t feel intimidated. Whether you already speak another Latin-based language (like Italian or French) or have had some exposure to the basics of Spanish itself, getting used to Spanish is unlikely to be a big challenge. That’s because these languages originated from a shared root language, so they not only have thousands of words in common (known as cognates) but other major similarities, down to their general grammar. That’s why you’ll find English words like “opinion” that are identical or nearly-so in French*(opinion)*, Italian*(opinione),*and Spanish*(opinión)*. Aside from the clear overlap in vocabulary and spelling, Spanish has a profoundly clear and consistent system of pronunciation. While languages like English are notorious for spelling and pronunciation irregularities, Spanish only has a few. That said, the Spanish alphabet is nearly the same as the one we use in English, so you only have three more letters to learn:*ch (chay), ll (elle),*and*ñ (eñe).*


  Using Rosetta Stone’s Dynamic Immersion® methodology, you’ll learn the language, not just the words. What makes it so effective is that we prepare you to use your new language in your everyday life. So it’s not just about the features, but what you’re able to do because of them. That way, you’ll be ready to handle any situation with ease and confidence.

  Some people choose to learn Spanish because they find themselves frequently
  encountering the language in their everyday lives. After all, Spanish pops up
  often in popular music, movies, and TV shows. Other people choose to learn
  Spanish based on personal plans to work, vacation, or volunteer in any of the
  20 countries around the world where Spanish is the official language. Whatever
  your reason for deciding to learn Spanish, you can get off to a great start by
  first learning how to pronounce some very basic Spanish words and phrases. It
  is an important step to understand and be understood by any of the 437 million
  people around the world who speak Spanish.


  Some beginning Spanish learners get sidetracked into trying to memorize lengthy lists of Spanish vocabulary words and phrases. This tedious and time-consuming effort can lead to the undesired outcome of having little-to-no ability to participate in everyday, real-world Spanish conversation. That’s why it’s strongly advised that new Spanish language learners focus on understanding and pronouncing basic words and phrases most commonly used in everyday Spanish conversation. This smart and practical approach to learning Spanish will help you become a confident and comfortable Spanish speaker.


  It’s worth noting that Spanish does have some pronunciation distinctions that can make it a challenge for language learners. As one example, the letter r is pronounced differently and takes some practice for most new learners. This distinct sound is formed by tapping the tip of the tongue on the roof of the mouth, about a third of the way back in the mouth. Some Spanish language experts suggest new Spanish learners practice making the “tt” sound, as it sounds in the English word butter.


  Acquiring the skills to accurately pronounce Spanish requires immediate feedback on your pronunciation efforts. Rosetta Stone helps you get the pronunciation just right in a snap with TruAccent. Our patented speech engine instantly compares your voice to native and non-native speakers, so you get real-time feedback for the most accurate pronunciation. It’s also adjustable, which allows you to fine-tune your accent. TruAccent is among the most powerful tools for helping you learn and speak the Spanish language.


  After you have developed the ability to understand and correctly pronounce basic Spanish words and short phrases, you can move onto learning the longer phrases that make up so much of everyday Spanish conversation. Rosetta Stone’s digestible, 10-minute language lessons are designed to lead you along this natural path to learning. With Rosetta Stone language lessons, you’ll first focus on learning Spanish basic words and phrases, then you’ll move onto learning longer Spanish phrases, and then towards learning to understand and speak Spanish with confidence. Rosetta Stone language lessons are built to help you learn Spanish vocabulary and correct pronunciation for everyday conversational situations.
