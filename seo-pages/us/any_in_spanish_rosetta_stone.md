  If you’d like to say “any” in Spanish, you have a few choices. If you intend
  to ask if someone wants “any,” you would use*“alguno”*(masculine)
  or*“alguna”*(feminine). If you are saying there are not “any,” or none, you
  would use*“ninguno”*(masculine) or*“ninguna”*(feminine). If you mean*any,*or
  whichever, is fine, you would use*“caulquier”*(masculine)
  or*“caulquiera”*(feminine). Here are some common examples:


  *¿Quieres alguna manzanas?*/ Do you want any apples?


  *No, no había ninguno libros.*/ No, there were not any books.


  *Cualquiera camisa está bien.*/ Any shirt is fine.


  Although Spanish pronouns might seem confusing, always remember that you don’t have to tackle them all at once. Even with a common word like “any,” getting comfortable with one option will likely work well in most circumstances. After you’re acclimated, you can slowly incorporate other pronouns with more nuanced meanings.


  And here’s the good news: if you already speak another major European language, learning Spanish is most likely attainable. Because English, just like Italian and French, has deep roots in Latin, these languages all share thousands of words with contemporary Spanish. These shared words are called cognates and have significant similarities in spelling and/or pronunciation. That’s why you’ll find English words like “opinion” that are identical or nearly-so in French*(opinion)*, Italian*(opinione),and*Spanish*(opinión)*.


  Spanish also has a simple system of pronunciation. Unlike English, there are only a few irregularities. The standard Spanish alphabet is also a near-exact match to English. It just has 29 letters instead of the 26 you’re used to. The extra three are:*ch (chay), ll (elle),*and*ñ (eñe)*.


  Rosetta Stone’s Dynamic Immersion® methodology teaches you the language, not just the words. What makes it effective is that we prepare you to use your new language in your everyday life. So, it’s not just about the features, but what you’re able to do because of them. It helps you get ready to handle situations with confidence.

  People want to learn Spanish for many different reasons. For some, hearing the
  language spoken throughout the U.S. and featured prominently on TV and in
  music is the driver. Others plan to vacation, volunteer or work in one of the
  20 countries around the world where Spanish is the official language. Whatever
  your reason, you can get off to a strong start by focusing first on what
  matters most—learning basic Spanish words and phrases and how to pronounce
  them. This is the foundation for understanding and conversing with any of the
  estimated 437 million people who speak Spanish fluently.


  Many times, new language learners get caught up in efforts to memorize long lists of Spanish words and phrases. And then they find themselves frustrated, unable to understand or be understood in everyday Spanish conversations. That’s why it’s important to learn to pronounce and understand commonly used Spanish words and phrases, so you can feel comfortable and confident speaking with locals.


  It’s worth noting that Spanish has some pronunciation distinctions that can make it a bit of a challenge for new learners. As one example, the letter*r*is pronounced differently and takes some practice for most new learners. This distinct sound is formed by tapping the tip of the tongue on the roof of the mouth, about a third of the way back in the mouth. Some Spanish language experts counsel new learners to practice making the “tt” sound, as it sounds in the English word butter.


  To hone your pronunciation, you’ll need immediate feedback on your efforts. Feedback will guide you in making needed corrections. Then you can practice until your mouth is able to readily shape the sounds that make up the language. Rosetta Stone helps you get it right in a snap with our TruAccent™ speech engine, which instantly compares your voice to native and non-native speakers to give you real-time pronunciation feedback. It’s also adjustable, which allows you to fine-tune your accent. TruAccent is among the most powerful tools for helping you learn and speak the Spanish language.


  After you have learned to pronounce basic words and short phrases, it’s a natural transition to move to the longer phrases that make up so much of everyday conversation. Rosetta Stone’s brief, 10-minute lessons are built in just this way, first teaching the basics, then tackling the longer phrases. This approach helps you acquire the skills to speak Spanish with confidence.
